All global variables in C guaranteed to be initialized to zero

If p is pointer, then *p is the thing that the pointer points to

while(*p1 == *p2){
	p1++;
	p2++;
}

*destination = *source; - To copy one element from one pointer to another

Is it worth checking for pointers being the same to save time for long strings
