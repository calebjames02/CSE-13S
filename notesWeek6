All global variables in C guaranteed to be initialized to zero

If p is pointer, then *p is the thing that the pointer points to

while(*p1 == *p2){
	p1++;
	p2++;
}

*destination = *source; - To copy one element from one pointer to another

Is it worth checking for pointers being the same to save time for long strings

typedef struct{ or struct mystruct{
	int i;
	char ch;
	double d;
} mystruct;

mystruct st;

int *p is an int;
Address of int is &int
int *p = &val;

struct *p;
*p.d = st.d
p->d is the same as the above
p[0]->d for an array of structs


typedef struct s_node Node;

struct s_node {
	int key;
	Node *next;
}
