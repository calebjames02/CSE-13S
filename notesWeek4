Make sure to include break statements when using switch, otherwise it will run all cases below the first one executed

Need to add a null terminator at the end of any string in c
Make the last character you want looked at in the string (0) - Just the number 0
This tells the program the string ends at that character
Only need to do this if you don't initialize string when you declare it

char ch[10] = "abc"; - Don't need to null terminate this

#include <string>
strlen
strchr

Might be useful for hangman

Can add functions if you want
Might want to add, is valid punctuation

#include <stdlib.h>
for exit maybe

int my_set[256];
my_set['a'] = 1;
my_set['b'] = 1;
my_set['z'] = 1;
starts indexing at 'a' and goes to 'z'
for(char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ++ch){
	if(set1[ch1]){
		printf("'%c' is in the set\n", set1[ch1]);
	}
}
