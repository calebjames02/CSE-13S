Do-while loop
do{

}while(something);

Does something and then checks the condition
If the condition is true, loops back to the top again

for(;;){} is the same as while(1){}

#include <assert.h>
assert(something);
Guaranteed to look for a non zero value, and if the condition is non zero it considers the condition to be true and it will continue running
If the result is zero the assertion fails, and it prints out an error message
